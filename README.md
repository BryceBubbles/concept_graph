# Concept Graph

An addon for node based content creation directly from the Godot engine editor.

The graph node can be as simple ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52043844/75927366-850e3080-5e6c-11ea-8596-ea8e1450c9e2.png)

... or as complicated as you want ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52043844/75927502-c69edb80-5e6c-11ea-9f40-21c1f9684786.png)

## Status

This addon is still a **work in progress**. Until it hits version 1.0, it is not
considered production ready and there's no guarantees the files generated with
this addon will be compatible with later versions.


### Known issues and roadmap

#### General issues
+ Save files needs improvement to make them work with future versions.
+ Missing Undo/Redo support
+ Search bar in the **Add node panel** doesn't work.
+ Overall performance could be improved.

#### Graph nodes issues
+ No **Output** node by default.
+ Duplicating graph nodes doesn't work.

#### Roadmap

1. Make it work
2. Make it user friendly
3. Make it fast

+ Right now my focus is on user experience and stability. I'm working on this tool
while also using it for my own game so I can actually see what's missing and
what part of the workflow could be improved for real world use.
+ New features will be added as I need them when the overall usability will be
good enough for most people.
+ Comment nodes, groups and other QoL features are planned.
+ At some point, I'd like to add some sort of control flow (conditional and loops)
but it likely won't be implemented anytime soon.
